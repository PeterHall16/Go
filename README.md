# Go
Testing and learning projects with Go.
This repository is just a collection of several learning exercises and projects regarding servers built with Go. 
A log of the progress/updates on this endeavor will be recorded in LOG.md.

## 6/16/2019 Update
I will no longer be adding to this repository indefinitely, as it is more efficient for me to include my learning processes with the Go projects I am currently working on.
