# Progress Log
## 6/16/2019
- Built a very simple localhost server based on this [tutorial](https://gowebexamples.com/http-server/). 
- Immediate goals:
    - Host a locally stored HTML file.
    - Work on hosting the server to the internet for testing/validation purposes.
- Notes: This may seem like a small, or unimpressive start, but it will get much better soon.
